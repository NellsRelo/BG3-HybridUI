HybridUI Is a mod designed to improve the Controller UI, implementing aspects of the KB+M UI, reducing the use of carousels, and making the UI more usable, especially for users with multiple modded races, classes, and spells.

# Progress
The release version is 0.5.0.1, and covers the following screens:
- Race Selection (CC)
- Subrace Selection (CC)
- Class Selection (CC)
- Subclass Selection (CC)
- Background Selection (CC)
- Deity Selection (CC)
- Spell/Cantrip Selection (CC)
- Spellbook (CC)
- Passive Selection (CC)
- Abilities Selection (CC)
- Skills Selection (CC)

It will be expanded to cover the Appearance section of CC, as well as Respec and Level-up UIs.

# Additional Features
HybridUI also provides a few additional benefits in Character Creation:
- Specially-named Cantrip/Spell Selectors now actually have their name in the tab bar
- Equipment Lists are now scrollable
- The scrollbar in Spell selectors and the Spellbook is now visible
- The Description box is decoupled from the selection interfaces, ensuring no strange gaps appear in the UI

# Compatibility
It has been tested alongside a significant amount of Race, Subclass, Spell, Deity, and Background mods to ensure it should work well even on the most heavily-modded of games.

It should be compatible with ImprovedUI (load IUI before this), KaiLimeUI, and other mods.
